### Product Overview

The online soft starter cabinet uses three-phase parallel thyristors as voltage regulators, which are connected between the power supply and the motor stator. Such a circuit is a three-phase fully controlled bridge rectifier circuit. When using a soft starter to start the motor, the output voltage of the thyristor gradually increases, and the motor gradually accelerates until the thyristor is fully turned on, and the motor works on the mechanical characteristics of the rated voltage to achieve smooth start, reduce the starting current, and avoid starting overcurrent tripping. The online soft starter cabinet also provides a soft stop function. The soft stop is the opposite of the soft start process. The voltage gradually decreases and the speed drops to zero to avoid torque impact caused by free stop.
### Performance characteristics：

1. Three inputs and three outputs, no bypass AC contactor is required, the product price is cheaper and the maintenance cost is lower

2. It can adapt to reliable operation in harsh environments such as smoke, dust, dust, sand, etc.

3. Complete protection functions, reliable performance, long service life and high economic benefits

4. Widely used in the start-up process of transmission equipment, fans, pumps, compressors, crushers and other loads

5. This product complies with GB14048.6-2008 and other standards

6. Wide working voltage range, simple and convenient wiring

### The main technical parameters:

1. Rated voltage: AC380V

2. Frequency: 50/60HZ

3. Applicable motor: squirrel-cage three-phase asynchronous motor

4. Starting frequency: when the motor starts with full load, no more than 4 times/hour, when no load or light load, it is recommended not to exceed 10 times/hour

5. Protection class: IP20

6. Cooling method: natural air cooling

7. Storage temperature: -25~70℃

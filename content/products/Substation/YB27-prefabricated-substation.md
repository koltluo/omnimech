## Product Overview
* * *

The YB27-12/0.4 model high/low voltage prefabricated substation (American style) is developed by absorbing foreign standard technology and combining actual domestic conditions. The entire unit is characterized by its small size, easy installation and maintenance, low noise, low loss, anti-theft, strong overload capacity, and full protection. It is suitable for use in newly built residential areas, green belts, parks, hotels near stations, construction sites, airports, and other locations. The YB27-12 series of American-style prefabricated substations are suitable for 10kV ring network power supply, dual power supply, or terminal power supply systems, serving as a substation, metering, compensation control, and protection device. This product complies with the following standards: GB/T17467-1998 "High Voltage Low Voltage Prefabricated Substation" and DL/T537-93 "Technical Conditions for the Ordering of 6-35kV Box Substations."

The product integrates the high-voltage load switch and high-voltage fuse into the transformer oil, featuring two structural forms: a common box for the transformer body or a separate box. The oil tank adopts a fully sealed structure, equipped with components such as an oil temperature gauge, oil level gauge, pressure gauge, pressure relief valve, and oil drain valve to monitor the operating conditions of the transformer. The product is available in ring network type, terminal type, and dual power supply types. To make the product more suitable for the actual requirements of China's power grid, a pluggable fuse has been introduced, where the melting of the fuse does not affect the performance of the transformer. According to the complexity of the low-voltage feeder requirements, the ZGS11 series of products are divided into three types of cabinet forms: standard, reinforced, and comprehensive, allowing users and design units to be more flexible and economical in the selection.

## Structural Features
* * *

1. Fully insulated, fully sealed, low maintenance, and reliable to ensure personal safety.

2. Compact structure, with a volume only one-third to one-fifth of the same capacity European type, and low height.

3. Can use a split-box structure to avoid contamination of the transformer oil inside the transformer tank.

4. The high voltage side uses dual fuses for full-range protection, greatly reducing costs.

5. It can be used both in a ring network and for terminals, and the cable head can be urgently inserted and removed under a 200A load current.

6. The cabinet is made of honeycomb double-layer composite panels, which have the function of insulation and heat dissipation.

7. The low voltage side is equipped with an electronic phase loss protector, which can quickly disconnect the main incoming switch when abnormal voltage appears in the system.

8. The high voltage side uses oil-immersed load switches or SF6 load switches, which can be electrically upgraded, laying the foundation for the automation of power distribution networks.

9. Oil-immersed S9 or S11 series transformers with better performance are used.

### Split-Box Structural Features
◆ The box transformer adopts a split-box structure:
The transformer body and high-voltage components such as the high-voltage load switch, insert-type fuse, and backup current-limiting fuse are placed in sealed oil tanks, with the two boxes horizontally arranged on the left and right, separated by a partition. The partition has insulated through-wall bushings for wiring between the transformer and the load switch, which can be conveniently replaced without affecting the use of the other box.

◆ The advantages of the left and right arrangement of the two boxes:

◆ The two boxes do not affect each other:

— It prevents the upper oil from flowing into the bottom oil tank due to leakage of the partition, causing a lack of oil in the upper oil tank (a lack of oil or no oil can lead to arcing when operating the load switch, which is dangerous for equipment and personnel);
— Another advantage is that maintenance is convenient. When the transformer room and the load switch room are repaired, the two boxes do not affect each other, which is fast and convenient (for example, if the transformer is arranged vertically, the upper oil tank must be completely dismantled before the transformer's oil tank can be opened, making maintenance very inconvenient).

◆ The split-box structure solves the problem of transformer oil contamination caused by the operation of the load switch and the melting of the fuse.

### Transformer Technical Parameters
The new S9 series transformer body is selected, with low loss, good overload capacity, strong short-circuit resistance, and all fasteners have been treated for anti-loosening, no need for core lifting; the S10 series and S11 series transformers with better performance can also be selected.

### Load Switch Technical Parameters
The load switch is an oil-immersed, three-phase linkage switch with a spring operating mechanism; it can operate with load switching on and off, and its switching speed is independent of the operating force size. There are two types available for selection: two-position, four-position T-type, and four-position V-type.

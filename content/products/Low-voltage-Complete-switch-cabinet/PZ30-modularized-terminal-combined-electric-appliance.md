### Product Overview

Pz30 modularized terminal combination electric appliance is a new type of product developed in our country in recent years. It is widely used in industrial and mining enterprises, shops, hospitals, stations, ports, high-rise buildings and residential buildings, etc., as a complete set of equipment for circuit power distribution and control, and protects the circuit from overload, short-circuit leakage, and overvoltage Combined electrical appliances It is used in the end circuit of single-phase three-wire or three-phase five-wire with AC frequency 50Hz, rated voltage 220V or 380V, and maximum total load current of 100A.

### Performance characteristics：

The cabinet has a reasonable structure and a novel shape. It adopts a plastic shell and an open door cover for easy operation. Combined electrical appliances have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60 loops in any combination of various modular electrical components, which are mounted on a H35 standard on the track. The wiring scheme is flexible in combination, can be connected in various forms, and can be connected to the zero row and the ground row.

There are two types of installation: surface-mounted (suspended) and concealed-mounted (wall-mounted). Knock-out holes for incoming and outgoing wires are provided on the top, bottom and back of the cabinet to facilitate wiring.

The box is made of galvanized wrench, PVC, stainless steel and other materials. The maximum cross-sectional area of the main incoming cable is generally 25mm.

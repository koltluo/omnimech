### Performance characteristics：

1. This series of products has high breaking capacity, good dynamic and thermal stability, advanced and reasonable structure, practical electrical scheme, strong series and versatility;

2. Various program units can be combined arbitrarily, and one cabinet can accommodate more circuits, saving floor space, beautiful appearance, high protection level, safe and reliable, and convenient maintenance.

3. This product complies with the ICE439 standard and the national standard GB7251 "Low-voltage switchgear and control equipment".

4. The frame is made of special-shaped steel, and the three-dimensional plate is used for positioning, and the bolt is connected without welding structure, so as to avoid welding deformation and production stress, and improve the installation accuracy;

5. The mounting holes of the frame and parts change according to the modulus E=25mm;

6. The internal structural parts are galvanized, and the exterior is sprayed with electrostatic epoxy powder after pickling and phosphating;

7. In the power center (PC) incoming cabinet, the top is the horizontal busbar area, and the lower part of the horizontal busbar area is the circuit breaker room;

8. The inclination to the vertical plane shall not exceed 5°.

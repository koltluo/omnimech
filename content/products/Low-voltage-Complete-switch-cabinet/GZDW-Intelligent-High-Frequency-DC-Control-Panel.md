### Product Overview

The GZDW Intelligent High - frequency DC Screen is a state - of - the - art product in the field of direct current power supply systems. This intelligent high - frequency DC screen is designed to provide reliable and stable DC power for various electrical equipment, especially in critical applications where continuous power is essential.

With advanced intelligent control technology, the **GZDW Intelligent High - frequency DC Screen** can automatically adjust its output parameters according to the actual load requirements. This not only ensures high - efficiency power utilization but also extends the service life of the connected equipment. The high - frequency design of the screen enables it to have a smaller size and lighter weight compared to traditional DC screens, making it more suitable for installation in limited spaces.

One of the key features of the GZDW Intelligent High - frequency DC Screen is its high reliability. It is equipped with multiple protection functions, such as over - voltage protection, under - voltage protection, over - current protection, and short - circuit protection. These protection mechanisms safeguard the screen and the connected devices from potential damage caused by abnormal electrical conditions.

Moreover, the **GZDW Intelligent High - frequency DC Screen** is easy to operate and maintain. It has a user - friendly interface that allows operators to monitor and control the screen's operation conveniently. The modular design of the screen makes it easy to replace components in case of failure, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

In summary, the GZDW Intelligent High - frequency DC Screen is an ideal choice for industries and applications that require a stable, reliable, and intelligent DC power supply solution. Whether it is for power plants, substations, or other electrical facilities, this high - frequency DC screen can meet the diverse needs of modern electrical systems. 

GZDW series DC screen with cadmium nickel battery, floating charger, equipped with automatic detection and alarm device, has long service life, no pollution, convenient maintenance, stable voltage, ultra-low internal resistance output, withstand large current impact and strong adaptability, reliability Advanced features, it is an ideal DC operating power supply device, which can be widely used in substations of 500kV and below and power plants below, and can also be used in metallurgy, mining, petroleum, radio and television, computer rooms, underground railways, high-rise buildings In construction and other departments, it is used as DC control, signal power supply, power failure protection and circuit breaker operating mechanism opening and closing power supply.

### Performance characteristicsï¼š

1. Two-way AC input controlled by microcomputer can be switched automatically;

2. AC input overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent, phase loss and zero automatic detection, display and alarm protection;

3. The charging and floating charging device adopts intelligent high-frequency switching rectifier module, N+1 redundant combination, automatic current sharing, and can be plugged and unplugged;

4. The process of battery equalization charge and float charge is automatically switched, and it can operate normally according to the computer settings. Disconnection of the power grid, recovery of power transmission and other procedures realize the intelligent floating charge management of the battery;

5. When the microcomputer control device fails or sends out wrong control commands, the charging module enters an autonomous working state, and the output voltage is the safe voltage set by the factory to ensure the reliability of the system operation.

6. The intelligent four-remote system provides detailed communication protocols for AC input, DC output, battery circuit and expanded environmental monitoring, and has an intelligent interface for communication with the substation integrated automation system.

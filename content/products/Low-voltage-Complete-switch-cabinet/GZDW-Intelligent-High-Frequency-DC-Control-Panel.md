### Performance characteristics：

1. Two-way AC input controlled by microcomputer can be switched automatically;

2. AC input overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent, phase loss and zero automatic detection, display and alarm protection;

3. The charging and floating charging device adopts intelligent high-frequency switching rectifier module, N+1 redundant combination, automatic current sharing, and can be plugged and unplugged;

4. The process of battery equalization charge and float charge is automatically switched, and it can operate normally according to the computer settings. Disconnection of the power grid, recovery of power transmission and other procedures realize the intelligent floating charge management of the battery;

5. When the microcomputer control device fails or sends out wrong control commands, the charging module enters an autonomous working state, and the output voltage is the safe voltage set by the factory to ensure the reliability of the system operation.

6. The intelligent four-remote system provides detailed communication protocols for AC input, DC output, battery circuit and expanded environmental monitoring, and has an intelligent interface for communication with the substation integrated automation system.

### Product Overview

GCS series combined low-voltage switchgear (hereinafter referred to as GCS complete switchgear). It is suitable for the power system of AC 50~60HZ, rated working voltage AC 380V, rated insulation voltage 660V, 1600KVA and below distribution transformer as power distribution, power, lighting, reactive power compensation, motor control center, and designed in the standard cabinet The mixed system of fixed scheme and withdrawal scheme can meet the different needs of users.

### Performance characteristics：

The basic frame of the switchgear is a combined assembly structure, all of which are fastened and connected by screws, plus doors, partitions, brackets, busbars, drawers and electrical components to form a complete switchgear with the following characteristics:

1. The overall size of the frame and parts and the size of the opening are changed according to the modulus E = 20mm;

2. Since all structural parts of the frame are fastened and connected by screws, welding deformation and stress are avoided, precision is improved, versatility is strong, applicability is good, and it has high mechanical strength, which fully meets the requirements of the switch cabinet. various performance requirements and changes;

3. In the MCC scheme, the interior of the switchgear is divided into three areas (rooms), the busbar area, the electrical equipment area and the cable area, and the three areas are separated by steel plates to ensure the normal operation of the line and effectively prevent the expansion of faults. When the drawer is pulled out of the cabinet, the charged body in the cabinet is not exposed, which is safe and reliable;

4. In the PC scheme, the manual mechanisms of AH and ME circuit breakers protrude out of the door. When operating by hand, there is no need to open the door panel, which is safe and convenient;

5. In the fixed scheme, it not only retains the characteristics of simplicity, practicality and low price of the fixed scheme, but also has the same appearance as a chest of drawers. Its interior is also divided into busbar area, electrical equipment area and cable area. The three areas are also equally It is safe and reliable to separate with steel plate or insulation board, and it is an ideal equipment to replace the old domestic fixed products;

6. The drawers of the MCC cabinet have four standard sizes, which are 200, 300, 400, and 600 respectively. They are light in structure, easy to assemble, and high in dimensional accuracy. The four standard sizes can be changed according to the design and user requirements. The drawer unit has Good interchangeability, and there are working position and separation position, the handle can be locked by padlock, and it is in the specified disconnection position;

7. The switchgear is designed for two power supply and consumption types of three-phase four-wire and three-phase five-wire power distribution system. The neutral bus N line and the protective grounding bus PE line are installed on the bottom of the cabinet, and the outlet end is used Busbar connection makes it very convenient for users to connect cables;

8. In order to ensure the reliable continuity of grounding, all common parts such as drawer rails in the cabinet are galvanized;

9. A natural ventilation net cover is provided on the top of the switchgear without reducing the protection level of the enclosure.

In short, the switchgear adopts the structure imitating foreign advanced cabinets, with high mechanical strength and high degree of standardization. It conforms to the IEC439 international standard and GB7251 national standard as a whole. Its protection level conforms to IP3X in GB4208 and is equivalent to IP30 in IEC529.

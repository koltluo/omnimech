### Product Overview

ZW32-24/630-25 outdoor high-voltage AC vacuum circuit breaker is an outdoor power distribution equipment with a rated voltage of 24kV and three-phase AC 50Hz. It is a switchgear developed by our company according to the long-term planning of my country's power system and relevant standards. It has the ability to break and close the load current, overload current and short-circuit current in the line. It is suitable for protection and control equipment in power distribution systems of substations and industrial and mining enterprises, and also suitable for rural power grids and places with frequent operations.
### Performance characteristics：

It adopts three-phase pillar structure, which has stable breaking performance, no danger of combustion and explosion, and the product also has the characteristics of temperature resistance, cold resistance, ultraviolet resistance and aging resistance.

Configuration function: It can be equipped with automatic terminal interface and intelligent FTU and other devices, which can meet the basic functions of power grid automatic operation.

### Product Overview

AB-3S-12 series outdoor high-voltage vacuum permanent magnet circuit breaker is a new generation of column-mounted vacuum circuit breaker newly developed by integrating advanced technology at home and abroad, adopting new design concepts, and using high-tech means. This product can be used as a switch on the 10kV side of the main transformer of a 35kV substation and a 10kV outgoing line switch, and can also be used as a pole-mounted switch in a distribution network. Combining with the controller produced by our company, it can conveniently realize control, protection, measurement, Communication is the first choice for realizing distribution network automation and miniaturization of substations.

### Performance characteristicsï¼š

The magnetic actuation (permanent magnet) mechanism is adopted to greatly reduce the number of components and the closing power, which is stable and reliable, and does not require regular maintenance;

Imported outdoor epoxy resin is used as the external insulation material, which is light in weight, has a service life of more than 15 years, has good weather resistance, is oil-free and SF6-free, and meets environmental protection requirements;

The opening and closing action time is short, the fault can be cut off quickly, and the protection coordination is convenient and flexible;

Use solar cells or CT as the power supply, and realize electric operation without external power supply;

The special remote control can be selected to realize remote control operation, and the power supply and stop operation can be carried out without the need to go up the stick;

The high-voltage isolating switch with integrated design is selected to make the structure compact and easy to install and maintain;

Stainless steel box, maintenance-free;

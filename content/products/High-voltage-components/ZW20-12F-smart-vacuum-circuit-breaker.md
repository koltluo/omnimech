### Product Overview

ZW20-12F intelligent vacuum circuit breaker is an advanced product improved from ZW20-12 pole-mounted circuit breaker and FZW28F-12 outdoor boundary vacuum load switch. It has manual and electric operation functions. The switch body adopts Japan Toshiba's VSP5-12 maintenance-free load switch, and the mature cold-rolled steel box-type sealing structure has good sealing performance, so that it is not affected by the external environment and is a maintenance-free product. The product uses vacuum arc extinguishing and SF6 gas as the insulating medium. The circuit breaker can be equipped with an intelligent controller, and the self-provided PT is used as the power supply to become an intelligent circuit breaker with voltage and current signal output and controllable. It is a good product for pole-mounted circuit breakers.

Box optional: stainless steel and cold-rolled steel and other materials;

Optional transformers: electronic current transformers and electronic voltage transformers;
### Performance characteristics：
1. Matching with the smart grid: it can realize functions such as three-stage protection, zero-sequence grounding protection, reclosing and remote communication;

2. Flexible and convenient operation: electric energy storage, electric separation and closing, manual energy storage, manual separation and closing, and short-distance or long-distance operation;

3. Small operating power and high reliability: The newly designed miniaturized spring operating mechanism reduces the operating power (about 30W) to the lowest level;

4. Reliable sealing performance: SF6 gas pressure is zero gauge pressure, and adopts mature sealing structure technology, reliable sealing performance, not easy to leak;

5. Unique way of entering and exiting wires: Silicone rubber sleeves are used to make the insulation distance between terminals sufficient and the external insulation performance is excellent;

6. Excellent safety performance: an explosion-proof device is installed on the top of the box, even if an internal failure occurs, no high-temperature gas or splash will leak out;

7. Flexible installation method: it can be hoisted on the pole or installed by sitting;

8. Large rated current: up to 1250A, strong breaking capacity, up to 25kA;

### Product Overview

ZW32-12(G)/T series outdoor high-voltage AC intelligent vacuum circuit breaker (hereinafter referred to as "intelligent circuit breaker") is an outdoor high-voltage power distribution switchgear with a rated voltage of 12kV and three-phase AC 50Hz, mainly used for breaking, It can close the load current, overload current and short-circuit current in the power system. It is suitable for protection and control in the power distribution system of substations and industrial and mining enterprises, and can also be used in places that require frequent operations such as rural power grids.

Smart circuit breakers comply with:

GB 1984—2014 "High Voltage AC Circuit Breakers"

DL/T 402—2007 "Technical Conditions for Ordering High Voltage AC Circuit Breakers"

DL/T 403—2000 "12kV～40.5kV High Voltage Vacuum Circuit Breaker Ordering Specifications"

DL/T 721-2013 "Distribution Automation System Remote Terminal" and other technical standards.
### Performance characteristics：
The overall structure is a three-phase pillar type, and the casing has good sealing performance;

The shell (cabinet) is made of SUS304 non-magnetic stainless steel material, which is precision welded and brightened (polished) by imported argon arc welding machine. It has a beautiful appearance and never rusts;

The vacuum interrupter is connected with the operating mechanism through the insulating rod, and the performance is stable and reliable;

Vacuum interrupter, main conductive circuit, insulating support and other components are cast into an organic whole with epoxy resin through APG process, and encapsulated with silicone rubber, which has good anti-condensation performance and mechanical strength;

It adopts a high-performance miniaturized spring operating mechanism, which has a simple structure and a long mechanical life. It also has the functions of electric and manual energy storage and opening and closing operations;

Novel structure, small size, light weight, easy to install;

It can realize functions such as three-stage protection, zero-sequence grounding protection, reclosing and remote communication;

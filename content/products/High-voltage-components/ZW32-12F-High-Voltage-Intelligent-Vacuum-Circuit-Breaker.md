### Product Overview

ZW32F-12F outdoor high-voltage AC intelligent vacuum circuit breaker is a user boundary switch independently developed by our company. It is mainly composed of ZW32-12 type outdoor vacuum circuit breaker body, FDR fault detection controller and external voltage transformer. The three parts are electrically connected through aviation sockets and outdoor sealed control cables. With fault detection function, protection control function and communication function, it can reliably judge and detect milliampere-level zero-sequence current inside and outside the boundary, and phase-to-phase short-circuit fault current, and realize automatic removal of single-phase ground fault and phase-to-phase short-circuit fault. FTU fault detection controller (commonly known as watchdog) can be equipped with bell jar type and square box type, which can realize the modernization of power grid: remote control, telemetry, remote adjustment, remote signaling, remote viewing and other functional features.
### Performance characteristics：
ZW32-12F outdoor high-voltage AC vacuum circuit breaker (hereinafter referred to as circuit breaker) is an outdoor power distribution equipment with a rated voltage of 12kV and three-phase AC 50Hz. It is mainly used for breaking and closing the load current, overload current and short-circuit current in the power system. It is suitable for protection and control in power distribution systems of substations and industrial and mining enterprises, and places where rural power grids are frequently operated.

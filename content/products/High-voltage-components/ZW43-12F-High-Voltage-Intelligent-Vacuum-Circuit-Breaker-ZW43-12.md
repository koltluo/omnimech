### Product Overview

ZW43-12 series outdoor high-voltage AC intelligent vacuum circuit breaker (hereinafter referred to as "intelligent circuit breaker") is an outdoor power distribution switchgear with a rated voltage of 12kV and three-phase AC 50Hz. It is mainly composed of the ZW43-12 outdoor high-voltage AC vacuum circuit breaker body , DK series distribution automation feeder terminals, external voltage transformers and control cables, etc., and can be equipped with lightning arresters, single-side isolating switches or double-side isolating switches according to user needs.

ZW43-12 outdoor high-voltage AC vacuum recloser has overload and short-circuit protection, quick-break protection, definite time delay protection and automatic recloser function, which can effectively ensure the good operation of the line.

> ZW43-12 outdoor high-voltage AC demarcation vacuum circuit breaker has remote management mode, protection control function and communication function, and can reliably judge and detect the boundary. It is used for control and protection in substations, industrial and mining enterprises, urban and rural power grids, especially suitable for In places and cities where frequent operations are required, milliampere-level zero-sequence current and phase-to-phase fault short-circuit current can be used to automatically cut off single-phase ground faults and phase-to-phase short-circuit faults.

Smart circuit breakers comply with:

GB 1984—2014 "High Voltage AC Circuit Breakers"

DL/T 402—2007 "Technical Conditions for Ordering High Voltage AC Circuit Breakers"

DL/T 403—2000 "12kV～40.5kV High Voltage Vacuum Circuit Breaker Ordering Specifications"

DL/T 721—2013 "Distribution Automation System Remote Terminal" and other technical standards
### Performance characteristics：

The overall structure is a three-phase pillar structure, using APG solid-sealed pole technology, with good sealing performance, good moisture-proof and anti-condensation performance;

It can be equipped with a double-side isolating switch to make the maintenance of circuits and electrical equipment safer;

Miniaturized design, small size, light weight, maintenance-free, long service life;

The operating mechanism is novel in design, simple in structure and reliable in action;

It can realize functions such as three-stage protection, zero-sequence grounding protection, reclosing and remote communication;

It can realize the "five remote" functions of power grid modernization (remote control, telemetry, remote adjustment, remote signaling, and remote viewing);

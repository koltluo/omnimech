### Product Overview

VSP5-12 series outdoor vacuum boundary switch is a combination circuit breaker with isolation, rated voltage 12KV, three-phase AC 50HZ high-voltage outdoor switchgear, the built-in voltage 12KV is converted to 220V operating voltage, mainly used for switching on and off rural power grids and urban power grids And load current, overload current, short circuit current of small power system. The overall structure of the product is a three-phase common box type. The three-phase vacuum interrupter is placed in a metal box, and the SMC insulation material is used for phase insulation and ground insulation.

### Performance characteristics：

1. Ideal equipment for urban and rural power grid reconstruction:

The vacuum circuit breaker and the intelligent controller can form an automatic recloser to realize the function of the recloser, as well as remote control, remote measurement, remote signaling and remote adjustment;

2. Flexible and convenient operation:

This product is electric energy storage, electric separation and closing, at the same time has manual energy storage, manual separation and closing, and can be operated by remote control at close or long distances;

3. Superior breaking performance:

Break short-circuit current 20KA (25KA) up to 30 times;

4. Low operating power and high reliability:

The newly designed small electric spring mechanism reduces the number of parts and the operating power (about 30W) to the lowest level;

5. With maintenance-free features:

The main circuit of the circuit breaker, the secondary components and the operating mechanism are all sealed in SF6 gas (zero gauge pressure) and are not affected by the external environment;

6. Reliable sealing performance:

Using mature sealing structure technology, the sealing performance is reliable;

7. Unique way of entering and exiting the line:

The silicone rubber sleeve is used to make the insulation distance between the terminals sufficient, and the external insulation performance is excellent;

8. Use safety:

An explosion-proof device is installed on the top of the box, even if an unexpected internal failure occurs, no high-temperature gas or splash will leak out;

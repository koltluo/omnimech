### Product Overview

**FZW28-12F outdoor boundary vacuum load switch** is used in the occasion of column installation, and has manual and electric operation functions. The switch body adopts VSP5-12 imported from Japan Toshiba Company, and this switch is a maintenance-free load switch. Vacuum arc extinguishing and SF6 gas are used as the ground and phase insulation medium. This product complies with: GB3804 "High Voltage AC Load Switch" and GBT11022 "Common Technical Requirements for High Voltage Switchgear and Control Equipment Standards". This instruction describes the structure, function and assembly method of the vacuum load switch on the column. FZW28(A)-12F outdoor boundary vacuum load switch (VSP5-12 switch body and FDR-01 controller) has fault detection function, protection control function and communication function. It is installed on 10KV overhead line and can realize automatic cutting of single phase Ground faults and phase-to-phase short-circuit faults are automatically isolated. The installation point is suitable for the responsibility demarcation point of the user's incoming line of 10KV distribution line, and it can also be applied for the branch line connection that meets the requirements.

### Performance characteristics：

1.Reliable sealing performance:

With mature sealing shell technology, the shell protection level reaches IP67, and the shell is processed by one-time mold stretching molding process, which is easy to seal the box, with high air tightness and high mechanical strength;

2.maintenance-free:

The main circuit of the load switch, the secondary components and the operating mechanism are all sealed in SF6 gas (zero gauge pressure), not affected by the external environment, with stable and reliable performance and maintenance-free;

3.Excellent line performance:

Porcelain sheathed cables or silicon rubber corner bushings are used to lead out, so that the phase distance can reach 280mm, and the external insulation performance is excellent;

4.Safe to use:

An explosion-proof device is installed on the top of the box, which can effectively prevent high-temperature gas or splashes from flying out when the switch fails;

5.Flexible installation methods:

It can be hoisted on the pole or installed by sitting on the pole;

6.Unique features:

It has unique functions such as automatic removal of single-phase ground faults, automatic isolation of short-circuit faults between phases, rapid location of fault points and monitoring of user loads, three-stage protection, reclosing, and remote communication;

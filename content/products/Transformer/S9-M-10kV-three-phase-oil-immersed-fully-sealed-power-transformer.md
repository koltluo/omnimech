### Product Overview


S9-M-10kV three-phase oil-immersed fully sealed power transformer is different from ordinary oil-immersed transformers. It cancels the oil storage tank, and the corrugated plate heat sink of the oil tank body is used for heat dissipation and cooling. Its elastic expansion and contraction compensates for the volume of the oil. increase or decrease. This series of products is suitable for 10KV, 50HZ power transmission and distribution systems, and can be used for power and lighting in residential areas, commercial streets, industrial and mining enterprises, and rural areas.

### Performance characteristics：

1. Low loss, significant energy saving

2. The iron core is a circular multi-stage, fully inclined three-stage seam lamination structure

3. The high and low voltage windings are all wound with oxygen-free copper wire, and the high voltage windings all adopt multi-layer cylindrical structure

4. Reasonable body structure

5. Using new components and fasteners

### Product Overview


![S11-M-10kV-oil-immersed-transformer](/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/45.png) 
S11-M series fully sealed oil-immersed power transformer has the advantages of low loss, low noise and high efficiency, which can achieve good energy saving effect and reduce pollution. Compared with the ordinary oil-immersed transformer, the fully-sealed transformer cancels the oil storage tank, and the change of oil volume is automatically adjusted and compensated by the elasticity of the corrugated sheet of the corrugated oil tank. The transformer is isolated from the air, preventing and slowing down the deterioration of oil and insulation aging. , Enhanced operational reliability, maintenance-free normal operation.

### Performance characteristics：

The three-phase oil-immersed distribution transformer produced by our company adopts a new type of insulation structure, which improves the short-circuit resistance capability, and the iron core is made of high-intelligence cold silicon steel sheet. The high-voltage windings are all made of high-quality oxygen-free copper wire, and adopt a multi-layer cylindrical structure, and all fasteners are specially loosened. The product has the characteristics of high efficiency and low loss, which can save a lot of power consumption and operating costs, and has remarkable social benefits. It is a high-paying technical product promoted by the country.

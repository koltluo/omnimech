### Product Overview


The SC(B)10 Epoxy Resin Cast Dry-Type Power Transformer is a revolutionary product in the field of power transformation. With its advanced **SC(B)10 Epoxy Resin Cast Dry-Type Power Transformer** technology, it offers unparalleled performance and reliability.

This transformer is designed to meet the diverse power needs of various industries. The epoxy resin casting ensures excellent insulation properties, which translates to enhanced safety and a longer service life. It effectively reduces the risk of electrical failures and short - circuits, making it a preferred choice for critical power applications.

The dry - type design of the **SC(B)10 Epoxy Resin Cast Dry-Type Power Transformer** eliminates the need for oil, thus avoiding potential oil leakage problems and associated environmental hazards. This makes it an environmentally friendly option for power systems.

In addition, the SC(B)10 series stands out for its low noise operation. Whether it is installed in commercial buildings, industrial plants, or residential areas, it won't cause excessive noise pollution. The low - loss characteristics of the transformer also contribute to energy savings, helping users reduce their electricity bills in the long run.

Moreover, the SC(B)10 Epoxy Resin Cast Dry - Type Power Transformer is highly adaptable. It can operate stably under a wide range of environmental conditions, including high - humidity and high - temperature environments. Its compact design allows for easy installation and space - saving, making it suitable for both new and retrofit projects.

Overall, the **SC(B)10 Epoxy Resin Cast Dry-Type Power Transformer** is a high - quality, efficient, and reliable solution for modern power systems. Its advanced features and benefits make it an ideal choice for those seeking a top - notch power transformation product. 

Resin insulated dry-type transformers are our company's introduction of foreign advanced technology, and independently developed SCB10 and SCB11 series thin-insulated dry-type transformers with fillers. Because the coils are encapsulated by epoxy resin, they are flame retardant, fireproof, explosion-proof, maintenance-free, and pollution-free. , Small size, can be directly installed in the load center. At the same time, the scientific and reasonable design and pouring process make the product less partial discharge, low noise, and strong heat dissipation capacity. It can run for a long time under 125% rated load under forced air cooling conditions, and is equipped with an intelligent temperature controller. Alarm, over-temperature alarm, over-temperature tripping and gate functions, and connected to the computer through the RS485 serial interface, can be monitored and controlled centrally.

### Performance characteristics：

①. The high voltage winding is made of enamelled copper wire, and the low voltage winding is made of copper foil. The high-voltage winding is filled with glass fiber felt, poured with imported epoxy resin without filler in vacuum state, and forms a solid whole after curing, with good mechanical strength, small partial discharge and high reliability.

②. Flame retardant, explosion-proof, non-polluting environment, can be installed in the load center.

③. The coil does not absorb moisture, and the iron core and clamps can be operated at 100% relative temperature and other harsh environments after special processing, and no dehumidification treatment is required for intermittent operation.

④.High resistance to short circuit and lightning shock.

⑤. The inner and outer resin insulation layers of the coil are thin, and the heat dissipation performance is good. The cooling method generally adopts air natural cooling (AN). The air cooling system (AF) can be configured for transformers of any protection class.

⑥. Low loss, good power saving effect, economical operation and maintenance-free.

⑦.Small size, light weight, small footprint, easy installation.

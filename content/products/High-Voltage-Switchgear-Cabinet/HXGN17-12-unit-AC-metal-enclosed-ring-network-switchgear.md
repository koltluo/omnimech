### Product Overview

The HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear is a high - quality electrical equipment designed for modern power distribution systems. It is specifically engineered to provide reliable and safe power control and protection in various industrial and commercial applications.

**HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear** is constructed with a sturdy metal enclosure, which offers excellent protection against environmental factors such as dust, moisture, and mechanical damage. This ensures its long - term durability and stable performance even in harsh operating conditions.

One of the key features of the **HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear** is its advanced insulation technology. The switchgear uses high - quality insulation materials to effectively prevent electrical breakdown and short - circuits, thereby enhancing the safety of the power system.

In addition, the HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear is equipped with intelligent control systems. These systems can monitor the operating status of the switchgear in real - time, detect faults promptly, and take appropriate protective measures. This not only reduces the risk of power outages but also simplifies the maintenance and management of the power system.

The **HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear** is also designed with flexibility in mind. It can be easily customized according to different user requirements, including the number of circuits, the rating of the switches, and the layout of the components. This makes it suitable for a wide range of power distribution scenarios.

Overall, the HXGN17 - 12 Box - type AC Metal - enclosed Switchgear is an ideal choice for those who are looking for a reliable, safe, and flexible power distribution solution. Whether it is for a small - scale commercial building or a large - scale industrial plant, this switchgear can meet your power control and protection needs effectively. 

HXGN17-12 box-type (fixed) metal-enclosed ring network switchgear (referred to as ring network cabinet) is a new type of high-voltage switchgear produced for the needs of urban power grid transformation and construction. In the power supply system, it is used to break the load current and close the short-circuit current. The ring network cabinet is equipped with a vacuum load switch, and the replacement mechanism is a spring operating mechanism, which can be operated manually or electrically. The switch and isolating knife are equipped with a dry-action operating mechanism. This ring network cabinet has a strong set-up, small size, no fire and explosion hazards, and has reliable "five-proof" functions.

### Performance characteristics：

The outside of the ring network cabinet is composed of a basic skeleton, a top plate, a panel, and a side plate to form a closed structure. The top of the ring network cabinet is the bus room, and the front of the bus room is the instrument room. The steel plates between the two rooms are separated. The upper part of the cabinet has a load switch room, and the middle and lower parts are cable entry and exit lines and other component rooms. The main equipment of the ring network cabinet It is composed of vacuum load switch, isolating switch (or isolating knife switch with fuse), earthing switch, lightning arrester, operating mechanism, interlocking mechanism and measurement and metering circuit, etc.


### Technical Parameters:

The ring network cabinet is mainly equipped with FZN21-1212/630 two-position vacuum load switch, and the main scheme is the inlet and outlet cabinets.

1. Incoming line cabinet scheme: a FZN21-12/630 two-position vacuum load switch is installed in the cabinet. The cabinet can also be flexibly equipped with CT and PT, and the main circuit is equipped with a FZN21-12630 vacuum load switch equipped with an isolation knife, which can respectively achieve connecting the busbar and isolating two stations

2. Outlet cabinet scheme: the cabinet is equipped with a FZ8N21-12/T125-1 5 load switch-fuse type combined electrical appliance, and CT, PT and ZnO lightning arresters, fuse combined electrical cabinets, and fuses can be flexibly assembled in the cabinet. The tube is equipped with a striker, and the striker strikes the tripping mechanism in case of a short circuit to realize quick disconnection and effectively protect electrical equipment.

3. "Five defenses" locking function:

① Power transmission operation: Only when the cabinet door is closed and locked, and the grounding switch is operated to the "open" position, can the load switch be operated to the closing position

② Power-off operation: When the load switch is in the off position, the grounding switch can be closed, and when the grounding switch is in the closed position, the cabinet door can only be opened when the insulation board is in place.

③ There is a reliable interlock between the vacuum fire chamber and the isolation knife, while the isolation knife and the grounding knife are interlocked with each other and interlocked with the cabinet door, and the insulation partition is also interlocked with the cabinet door

④Mechanical interlocking can also be realized between the two incoming cabinets, between the incoming cabinet and the outgoing cabinet.

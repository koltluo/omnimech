### Product Overview


The TBB□-10 high-voltage collective compensation device mainly avoids the disadvantages of large local compensation investment, equipment maintenance, and decentralized operation management. The centralized compensation device is mainly used in 3-10kV three-phase power frequency AC power system with small load changes. in the power system. The high-voltage reactive power centralized compensation device can compensate the reactive power required by the system online, so that the reactive power of the system can reach a static balance, so as to improve the power factor of the system, stabilize the system voltage, reduce losses, and save electricity costs.

### Performance characteristics：

The device is equipped with a series air-core reactor with a reactance rate of 0.5%-12%, which can suppress the fifth and above harmonics and limit the closing inrush current. The reactance rate can be configured according to user requirements.

The whole device adopts a frame structure, which is compact in structure, easy to install and maintain, and is equipped with safety measures of high-voltage live forced locking, which can ensure the personal safety of maintenance and operation personnel; it can ensure the safe operation of the equipment under the best environmental conditions

### The main technical parameters:

Rated voltage: 3kV, 6kV, 10kV, 24kV, 35kV.

Power frequency: 50Hz/60Hz.

Power factor: can reach above 0.95.

Residual voltage: 3 minutes after the power is disconnected, it can drop below sov.

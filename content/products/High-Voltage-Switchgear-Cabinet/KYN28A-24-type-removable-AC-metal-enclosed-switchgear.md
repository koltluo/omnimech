### Product Overview


This product is suitable for three-phase AC 50/60Hz power system, used to receive and distribute electric energy, and to control, protect and detect the circuit. The switchgear has two structural forms: armored cabinet and double busbar cabinet. It can be equipped with SF6 circuit breaker, VD4-24 circuit breaker, ZN72-24 fully insulated vacuum circuit breaker, and the secondary circuit is equipped with advanced and reliable control protection unit. The interior of the product adopts APG epoxy casting and reliable solid fully insulated busbar technology for full insulation design. It has good electric field distribution measures. It is a miniaturized switchgear with advanced technology, stable performance, reasonable structure, convenient use, safety and reliability.

### Performance characteristics：

★ The busbar adopts heat-shrinkable insulation material or epoxy-coated insulation means to optimize the shape of the electrodes, so that the cabinet structure is compact and the floor space is reduced.

★ The cabinet body is made of high-quality cold-rolled steel plates and imported aluminum-zinc coated plates, which are formed by CNC sheet metal processing and connected by high-strength bolts, nuts and rivet nuts.

★Insulation boards are installed in the busbar room, handcart room and cable room in the cabinet, which greatly improves the insulation level.

★ It can be equipped with domestic VS1-24 vacuum circuit breaker or Schneider's VH4 type or Alstom FP series sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker to meet the needs of different users.

★ The combined valve can be opened flexibly. As the circuit breaker is pulled out, the valve will automatically close and be locked forcibly, eliminating the danger of accidental contact with high-voltage electricity.

★ The friendly man-machine interface makes the operation of the switch cabinet programmatic and formulaic, and the operator can understand it at a glance.

★ There are more than 160 main wiring schemes, and the structure is highly adaptable to meet the needs of different users.

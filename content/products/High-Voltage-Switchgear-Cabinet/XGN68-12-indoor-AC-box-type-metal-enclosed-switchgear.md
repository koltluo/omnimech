### Performance characteristics：

The ZN100-12 vacuum circuit breaker and FZN58-12 vacuum load switch used in the XGN68-12 switchgear adopt vacuum arc chamber epoxy resin sealing technology, which has beautiful appearance, good insulation performance and convenient operation. The design of the rotating fuse structure is adopted in the cabinet, so that the replacement of the fuse can be realized It has beautiful appearance, good insulation performance and convenient operation. The designed rotating fuse structure is adopted in the cabinet, which makes the replacement of the fuse realize the draw-out type, which is very convenient. Pull-out type, very convenient.

### Technical Parameters:

1. The cabinet body is welded with high-quality angle steel.

2. The circuit breaker room is located in the middle (lower) part of the cabinet, which is convenient for installation, debugging and maintenance. Equipped with ZN63A (VS1-12) circuit breaker as standard, and equipped with a pressure release channel to ensure personal safety.

3. The advanced and reliable rotary isolating switch can be used to safely enter the circuit breaker room for inspection and maintenance when the main busbar is live.

4. The protection level of the whole cabinet is IP2X.

5. Equipped with a reliable and fully functional compulsory mechanical locking device, which is simple and effective to meet the requirements of "five defenses".

6. Have a reliable grounding system.

7. There is an observation window on the door, which can clearly observe the working status of the components in the cabinet.

8. The locking mechanism of the operating mechanism adopts the JSXGN locking mechanism used in the XGN2-12 cabinet, which is simple, reliable, convenient and practical.

9. The incoming and outgoing cables are lower than the front of the cabinet bottom, which is convenient for users to connect.

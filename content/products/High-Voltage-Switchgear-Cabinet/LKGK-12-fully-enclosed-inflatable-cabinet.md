### Product Overview


LCGK-12 fully insulated and fully enclosed inflatable metal switchgear (referred to as inflatable cabinet) is also known as common box type inflatable cabinet, sf6 inflatable cabinet. All its live parts are completely sealed in a 3.0mm thick stainless steel SF6 gas box, multiple branch switches can be installed in one gas box, so that the switchgear is not affected by the environment. It truly realizes functions such as maintenance-free, reliable operation, and unattended operation. The inflatable cabinet unit adopts a modular design, which can be flexibly expanded and scientifically combined. It is a fully insulated and fully enclosed high-voltage switchgear. It is suitable for 50HZ, 12kv three-phase AC high-voltage power distribution system for receiving and distributing high-voltage electric energy. Because of its strong adaptability, it is widely used in mines, coastal areas, alpine plateau areas, airports, hotels, schools, subways, municipal construction and other industries.

### Performance characteristicsï¼š

1. Fully insulated and fully enclosed, all live equipment in the inflatable cabinet is encapsulated in a stainless steel gas box, and the outgoing cables are connected by closed cable plugs, which can effectively isolate the environmental impact.

2. The inflatable cabinet adopts a modular design, which can flexibly expand the unit, while occupying an area of more than 50% less than that of conventional high-voltage switch cabinets.

3. The protection level of the shell is high. The gas box of the inflatable cabinet is made of 3.0mm thick stainless steel plate welded by a welding robot.

4. The inflatable cabinet can choose electric operation or manual operation, and at the same time realize the remote monitoring function, with a high degree of intelligence.
